## A small Unity project demonstrating my skills with C# and Unity: 
- Unity analytics integration Uploaded web version on itch.io and used unity analytics to collect data about playtime, game-specific stuff such as score, combos etc.)
- Uses Unity Shader graph for a pretty hypno-background
- Relies a lot on coroutines
- Uses DOTween as tweening engine for good-looking animations
- UI with dialogue system
- Timer management
- Camera movement

This is one of my earlier projects
